# BusinessManageProject

The project was created in order to bring customers closer to the service providers of some business industries.
I am trying to improve the interaction of the main participants in these processes.
The client is provided with tools for convenient searching for the specialists of a business,
filtering them according to position and checking their schedules for a concrete date.
Four main roles are present in the project:
- Owners are superusers who have all permissions.
- Admins can make appointments for clients with the specific specialist at the concrete his free working time.
- Managers create profiles for the specialists, add working locations and schedule for specialists.
- Specialists - company employees.
