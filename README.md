# BusinessManageProject


Project was created in order to bring customers closer to the service providers of the some business industry.    
I am trying to improve the interaction of the main participants in these processes. 
The client is provided with tools for convenient searching the specialists of a business,
filtering them according position and checking their schedules for concrete date. 
In project is present three main role: an owner, an admin and a manger.
Admin can make an appointments for clients to the specific specialist at the concrete his free working time. 
Manger creates profile for the specialists, adds working locations and schedule for specialists.
